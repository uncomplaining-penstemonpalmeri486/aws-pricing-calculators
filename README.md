## Approach

These calculators differ from AWS's official pricing calculator:
- Single-service focus vs multi-service estimates
- 3-5 input fields vs 20+ fields per service
- 2-3 minute estimates vs 15-20 minute configuration
- No account required vs account recommended

Use AWS's official calculator for enterprise migrations, Reserved Instance modeling, or when you need PDF exports for procurement
